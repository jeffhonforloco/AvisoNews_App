#### Improvements Over Previous Version
- No longer dependent on unreliable third-party RSS parsers
- Better error handling and recovery
- Supports more RSS feed variations
- Faster parsing with optimized regex patterns

### 3. Retry Logic & Error Handling

#### Exponential Backoff
- Configurable retry attempts per source (default: 2-3 retries)
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- Smart retry logic that doesn't retry on rate limits

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging with source identification
- Graceful degradation when sources fail
- Continues processing other sources even if some fail
- Detailed error messages for debugging

#### Rate Limit Awareness
- Detects and handles HTTP 429 (rate limit) responses
- Skips retries for rate-limited requests
- Logs warnings for rate limit hits

### 4. Smart Deduplication

#### Multi-Level Deduplication
- **URL-Based**: Primary deduplication by canonical URL (case-insensitive)
- **Title-Based**: Secondary deduplication by title similarity
- **Time Window**: Prevents duplicate detection for articles published within 1 minute
- **Smart Matching**: Handles URL variations and encoding differences

#### Benefits
- Cleaner article feeds
- No duplicate stories
- Better user experience

### 5. Intelligent Update Scheduling

#### Features
- **Automatic Updates**: Updates every 10 minutes (configurable)
- **Priority-Based**: Sources with higher priority get more frequent updates
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive update statistics
- **Non-Blocking**: Initial fetch delayed 2 seconds after server start
- **Concurrent-Safe**: Prevents multiple simultaneous updates

#### Statistics
- Total updates count
- Success/failure tracking
- Total articles fetched
- Success rate calculation
- Last update timestamp
- Hourly statistics logging

### 6. Performance Optimizations

#### Parallel Processing
- All sources fetched in parallel using `Promise.allSettled`
- Continues processing even if some sources fail
- Faster aggregation with concurrent requests

#### Memory Management
- Efficient article deduplication
- Clean article data structures
- No memory leaks

#### Timeouts
- Configurable request timeouts per source
- Default 10-second timeout
- AbortController for clean timeout handling

### 7. Enhanced Article Processing

#### Article Enrichment
- Automatic excerpt generation (200 characters)
- Summary field population
- Featured article flagging (top 3 from each source)
- Image URL extraction and validation
- Published date parsing and normalization

#### Data Quality
- Title cleaning (removes bracketed content)
- Description HTML sanitization
- URL validation
- Proper date handling

### 8. Logging & Monitoring

#### Comprehensive Logging
- Source-by-source fetch results
- Article counts per source
- Success/failure summaries
- Aggregation timing
- Error details with context

#### Statistics
- Update statistics endpoint
- Real-time update status
- Historical performance tracking

## üìä Technical Details

### Source Configuration
Each news source has:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Name**: Display name
- **Type**: RSS, NewsAPI, NewsData, or GoogleNews
- **URL**: RSS feed URL (for RSS type)
- **Category**: Article category
- **Priority**: 1-10 (higher = more important)
- **Retries**: Number of retry attempts
- **Timeout**: Request timeout in milliseconds
- **Active**: Whether source is currently active

### Update Flow
1. Server starts ‚Üí Auto-update job initializes
2. Wait 2 seconds ‚Üí Initial fetch begins
3. Fetch all active sources in parallel
4. Parse and process articles
5. Deduplicate articles
6. Add to store
7. Log statistics
8. Schedule next update (10 minutes)

### Error Recovery
- Failed sources are logged but don't stop other sources
- Retries with exponential backoff
- Rate limits are detected and handled gracefully
- Empty results are logged but don't cause failures

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_key_here      # Optional: Enhances news coverage
NEWSDATA_KEY=your_key_here     # Optional: Enhances news coverage
```

### Source Activation
Sources are automatically activated based on:
- `active` flag in source configuration
- API key availability (for API-based sources)
- No manual configuration needed for RSS sources

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- **Fetch Time**: 5-15 seconds for all sources
- **Articles per Update**: 200-500+ articles
- **Update Interval**: 10 minutes
- **Success Rate**: 90%+ with proper network

### Optimization Strategies
- Parallel fetching reduces total time
- Retry logic increases reliability
- Deduplication ensures quality
- Smart scheduling prevents overload

## üéØ What Makes This Better Than Apple News

1. **More Sources**: 30+ sources vs. Apple News' curated selection
2. **Open APIs**: Uses free/open APIs, not proprietary
3. **Transparency**: All sources are visible and configurable
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new sources
5. **Real-time**: Updates every 10 minutes
6. **Smart Deduplication**: Better duplicate handling
7. **Error Resilience**: Continues working even if some sources fail
8. **Statistics**: Built-in monitoring and statistics

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Database storage (currently in-memory)
- Content extraction (full article text)
- Sentiment analysis
- Trend detection
- Source reliability scoring
- Custom source addition via admin panel
- Webhook support for real-time updates

## üìù Notes
